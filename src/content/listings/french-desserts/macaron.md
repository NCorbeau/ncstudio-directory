# Macaron

The French macaron (not to be confused with the coconut macaroon) is an elegant meringue-based confection consisting of two delicate almond cookies sandwiching a flavorful filling. Known for their smooth, domed tops, ruffled "feet," and endless variety of colors and flavors, macarons have become one of the most recognizable symbols of French pastry artistry.

## History and Origin

The origin of the macaron is disputed, with some sources tracing it back to 8th century Venetian monasteries, while others claim it originated in French monasteries during the Middle Ages. One popular story credits Catherine de Medici with bringing macaron-making to France from Italy when she married Henry II in the 16th century.

Initially, macarons were simple almond cookies without fillings. The macaron as we know it today—two cookies sandwiching a filling—emerged in the early 20th century. Ladurée, a famous Parisian patisserie, claims that Pierre Desfontaines, the grandson of Ladurée's founder, first thought of sandwiching two macaron shells together with ganache filling.

## Characteristics

A perfect macaron exhibits:

- A smooth, glossy, domed top with no cracks
- A distinctive ruffled edge at the base, known as the "foot" or "pied"
- A slightly chewy interior beneath a thin, crisp shell
- A balanced filling-to-cookie ratio
- Vibrant, even coloring (if colored)
- A harmonious flavor profile between shell and filling

## Traditional Preparation

Creating macarons requires precision and technique:

1. **Prepare the tant pour tant** - A mixture of finely ground almonds and powdered sugar
2. **Make the meringue** - Whip egg whites with granulated sugar until glossy peaks form (typically using the French, Italian, or Swiss method)
3. **Macaronage** - Fold the tant pour tant into the meringue with a specific technique to achieve the right consistency
4. **Pipe** - Pipe uniform circles onto parchment paper
5. **Rest** - Allow the piped batter to rest until a skin forms on the surface
6. **Bake** - Bake at a precise temperature to develop the characteristic feet
7. **Fill** - Once cooled, pair similar-sized shells and sandwich with filling
8. **Mature** - Allow the filled macarons to rest in the refrigerator for 24-48 hours to develop optimal texture and flavor

The most challenging aspects of macaron-making include achieving the right batter consistency during macaronage, managing oven temperature, and properly developing the feet.

## Classical Flavors

Traditional macaron flavors include:

- **Vanilla** - A timeless flavor often made with real vanilla bean
- **Chocolate** - Using high-quality cocoa in the shells and chocolate ganache filling
- **Pistachio** - Featuring ground pistachios in the shell and pistachio paste in the filling
- **Raspberry** - Pink shells with raspberry jam or buttercream
- **Coffee** - Coffee-infused shells with coffee buttercream
- **Lemon** - Yellow shells with tart lemon curd or buttercream
- **Rose** - Delicate pink shells with rose-flavored buttercream
- **Caramel** - Tan shells with salted caramel filling

## Modern Innovations

Contemporary patisseries constantly innovate with unique flavor combinations:

- **Salted Caramel** - A modern classic combining sweet and salty notes
- **Matcha Green Tea** - Featuring Japanese matcha powder
- **Passion Fruit** - Tangy, tropical filling with neutral or complementary shells
- **Ispahan** - Pierre Hermé's famous creation combining rose, lychee, and raspberry
- **Savory Macarons** - Experimental flavors like foie gras, truffle, or cheese
- **Seasonal Creations** - Limited-edition flavors that showcase seasonal ingredients

## Filling Varieties

Macaron fillings can include:

- **Ganache** - A mixture of chocolate and cream
- **Buttercream** - Light and fluffy sweetened butter
- **Jam or Fruit Curd** - Provides a tangy contrast to the sweet shells
- **Cream Cheese Frosting** - Often used in American adaptations
- **Caramel** - Either firm or flowing caramel centers

## Cultural Significance

Macarons have transcended their culinary origins to become cultural icons. Their appearance in films like "Marie Antoinette" and "Gossip Girl" has cemented their status as symbols of luxury and Parisian sophistication. They're now popular at weddings, bridal showers, and other special events, often color-coordinated to match event themes.

## Where to Find the Best Macarons

Paris is home to the most renowned macaron makers:

- **Ladurée** - The historic house that popularized the modern macaron
- **Pierre Hermé** - Known as the "Picasso of Pastry" for his innovative flavor combinations
- **Pierre Marcolini** - Belgian chocolatier famous for his refined macarons
- **Sadaharu Aoki** - Japanese-French fusion featuring flavors like wasabi and sesame
- **Carette** - A classic Parisian tea room with excellent traditional flavors

## Storage and Serving

For optimal enjoyment:

- Store macarons in an airtight container in the refrigerator
- Bring to room temperature 20-30 minutes before serving
- Consume within 3-5 days for best texture and flavor
- Never freeze filled macarons (though unfilled shells can be frozen)
- Serve with tea, coffee, or champagne for an authentic French experience

## Macaron versus Macaroon

Though their names are similar, French macarons and macaroons are entirely different:

- **Macaron** - The delicate French sandwich cookie made with almond flour and meringue
- **Macaroon** - A dense, chewy cookie primarily made with shredded coconut, popular in the United States and United Kingdom

This distinction is important to French pastry purists, who consider the macaron one of the most sophisticated expressions of patisserie art.
